        In 2007, the highest grossing film was <u>Spider-Man 3</u>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/fastandbulbous/2662278485/in/set-72157606131347588", target="_new">Tim Reddy</a> had an @aol.com email address, and
        "Sound Fix," a bar in Brooklyn, held music trivia every Tuesday night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stephen and his group of friends attended religiously and a major reason for their attendance was <strong>Mona</strong>,
        who wrote the questions, worked the bar - and was generous with buy-backs.<br/>
      </p>

      <p>
        One night Stephen got to the bar early.
        He saw Mona's book behind the counter - she was reading <u>Revolutionary Road</u>. Stephen was reading Hemmingway's <u>Garden of Eden</u> -
        a book where a wife strong-arms her husband into cutting and bleaching his hair to match hers and then violates him.<br/>
        Ah yes - romance perfumed the night air.

        Weeks later, at Music Trivia - Stephen invited Mona to a party (that he never ended up throwing) - to celebrate the 25 year anniversary
        of The Kinks album "Village Green Preservation Society." Mona sounded enthusiastic enough and passed a note to Stephen with her email address
        and this caveat: <em>"I like Dave Davies more than Ray Davies."</em>
      </p>
